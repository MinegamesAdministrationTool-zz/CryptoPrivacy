This file was originally named MineCrypto but changed to CryptoPrivacy whatever it encrypt text, files with aes and tripleDES and hashes passwords or text whatever if you liked it please give me a star it will make me know that this kind of programs are wanted! also don't use this project code ever maliciously or you will be law suited and go to jail (not kidding), but if you used it just to protect your privacy and data the developer really thanks you!
